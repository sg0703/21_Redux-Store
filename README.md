# Redux Store

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

This is a refactor of an existing full-stack store application. The original app used React Context to manage global state. I refactored it to use Redux instead of Context. The app uses React, Redux, MongoDB Atlas, Node, Express and Stripe for payment processing.

Please view the deployed version HERE.
